						The goal of the project was to investigate on the problem of micro-expression analysis from visual perspctive. As oppose to normal-expression, micro-expression is a kind of subconscious expression that could reveal actual and suppressed emotion, so it possesses high research value in criminal investigation and medical consultation. The short duration and subtle facial movement makes it hard for human beings to recognize micro-expression. Therefore, high frame rate data acquisition and computer vision techniques are employed in the analysis.

						The main problem in existing databases is the fixed head posture, which makes the algorithm impractical for natural scene processing. To tackle with this problem, we improved the experiment settings by including macro head motion (both in-plane and out-plane movement) and recording the videos using high frame rate video camera. We designed and conducted experiments using ideas borrowed from psychological literature to collect raw video data with high frame rate to capture subtle facial movement and established a dataset with annotations. Sample frames are shown below.

						The video recorder we used in our experiment is SONY NEX-FS700CK digial motion picture camera. The raw data is collected under 480fps, 720p configuration, which is sufficient for us to capture the micro-expression. 40 videos are recorded in total and the average length is 2.5~3.2s.

						Close observation reveals that the overall movement (head movement and facial expression) can be decomposed in three separate parts: <b>in-plane motion</b>, <b>out-plane motion</b> and <b>micro-expression</b>. Following this idea, we could get rid of head movement and extract the micro-expression.
							 <ol>
							  <!-- Step 1 -->
							  <li>
							  	<p align=justify>
							  		The characteristic of in-plane movement is that the general structure of human face remains the same during the process, despite the subtle distortion caused by micro-expression and occlusion due to out-plane motion. Thus if we vectorize each frame and group them in a matrix, the matrix should be of <b>low rank</b>. Then we could model the in-plane movement as image transformation and remove it via <b>Robust PCA</b>.

							  	<p align=justify>
							  		As shown in the above figure, <i>d</i> is the instance of the movement we observe in the images; &tau; is the in-plane movement that we consider as image transformation; <i>a</i> is the general facial structure; <i>e</i> is the subtle noise caused by out-plane movement and micro-expression. This could be considered as a <b>Robust PCA</b> problem, and the in-plane movement &tau; could be solved and removed from the video. The result is shown as follow.

							  <!-- Step 2 -->
  							  <li>
							  	<p align=justify>
							  		We could not simply apply the same technique to the out-plane movement due to the occlusion caused by it. However, observation shows that the <b>motion trails</b> of pixels still have the low rank property, and this time we could treat the micro-expression as the sparse error. In this way, we could separate out-plane movement and micro-expression. Optical flow method is employed to track the motion of pixels along the image sequence.

						After separating the micro-expression, we could do enhancing easily since we already know all the information of the movement. We could also do classfication to recognize micro-expressions. Experiment result shows that the low amplitude of expression is the key issue of the micro-expression analysis. The intensity change cause by the micro-expression is comparable with that caused by illumination change or even noise, thus we have an exremely poor SNR in this system. In order to improve performance of the algorithm, a beeter detection algorithm should be proposed in the future.
